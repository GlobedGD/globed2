# This file is a list of allowed IP ranges.
# In release mode, if the "cloudflare_protection" option is enabled, some endpoints will block any requests
# that are not originated from one of these IP ranges.
# In debug or with the "cloudflare_protection" option disabled this file has no impact on anything, no IP addresses will be blocked.
#
# Use hashtags for comments and separate ranges by newlines. Start with 'v4' or 'v6' depending if it's IPv4 or IPv6.
# NOTE: These are included in the executable at compile time. If you want to change anything here, you have to recompile the server.
