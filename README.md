# Globed

Globed is an open-source, highly customizable multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash.

This repository contains the complete rewrite of Globed, for Geometry Dash 2.2 and all future versions. If you want the 2.1 version, the [old repository](https://github.com/dankmeme01/globed) is still up, however it is no longer maintained.

## Features

* Real-time multiplayer
* Voice chat with **strong encryption and zero logging/storage**
* Fully open-source, including the server

## Installation

Globed is a [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org) mod, so it requires you to install Geode first. Once that's done, simply open the mods page in-game and download it from the index.

## Hosting a server

See the [server readme](./server/readme.md) for more information about the server and how you can host it.
