# Globed

Globed is an open-source, highly customizable multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash.

This repository contains the complete rewrite of Globed, for Geometry Dash 2.2 and all future versions. If you want the 2.1 version, the [old repository](https://github.com/dankmeme01/globed) is still up, however it is no longer maintained.

## Features

* Real-time multiplayer
* Voice chat and text messages with **full encryption and zero logging/storage**
* Available on three of the major platforms (Windows, Mac and Android)
* Fully open-source, including the server code

## Installation

Globed is a [Geode](https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode) mod, so it requires you to install Geode first. Once that's done, simply open the mods page in-game and download it from the index.

## Roadmap

Planned features:

* wait for 2.2

Known issues:

* i am silly
* needs more unsafe code to be even more blazinger faster 🚀🚀🚀

## Hosting a server

See the [server readme](./server/readme.md) for more information about the server and how you can host it.
