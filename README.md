# Globed

Globed is an open-source, highly customizable multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash.

## Installation

Globed is a [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/) mod, so it requires you to install Geode first. Once that's done, simply open the mods page in-game and download it from the Geode Index.

## Features

- Real-time multiplayer
- Completely free and open-source, easy to host your own server
- Available for Windows, Android, and MacOS
- In-game voice & text chat
- Public & private rooms

## Hosting a server

See the [server readme](./server/readme.md) for more information about hosting a server. If you have any troubles or suggestions, you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/d56q5Dkdm3) or make an issue.

## Building

Build like any other mod, see [Geode documentation](https://docs.geode-sdk.org/getting-started/cpp-stuff).

- Only compiler supported is Clang, MSVC is unsupported since release v1.7.0 (for Geode v4).
- If compiling on Linux, `clang-cl` is required instead of regular clang.
