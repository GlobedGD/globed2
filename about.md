# Globed

Globed is an open-source, highly customizable multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash.

## Usage

In the main menu, an extra button is added to the bottom row. This button opens the Globed Menu, where you can join a server and start playing online with others.

If you have any issues, suggestions, or just want to follow the development of the mod, you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/d56q5Dkdm3)!

## Support

Globed is a <cg>completely free</c> mod, and will never require any payment to use.

However, if you'd like to support the developer and help us with server expansions, you can contribute through our [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/globed)!

As a token of appreciation, you will receive a <ca>purple</c> name, an in-game badge, and a special role on our Discord server. :)
