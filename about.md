# Globed

Globed is an open-source, highly customizable multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash.

## Usage

In the main menu, an extra button is added to the bottom row. This button opens the Globed Menu, where you can join a server and start playing online with other people.

If you have any issues, suggestions or just want to see the development of the mod, you can join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/d56q5Dkdm3)!

## Support

Globed is a <cg>completely free</c> mod, and will never require any payment to use.

But if you want to support the developer and help us pay for server expansions, you can do it on our [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/globed)!

As a sign of appreciation, you will get a nice <ca>purple</c> name and a badge in-game, and a role on our discord server :)
