## v1.1.0

Globed now uses a different networking protocol (hybrid TCP/UDP instead of just UDP). This should fix **many (but not all!) of the connection related issues**, such as players not loading in a level, or the player list popup taking an infinite amount of time to load.

That means this is a **required** update which bumps the protocol version to 2. You will not be able to connect to an updated server without updating the mod to this version.

If you are a server owner, please read the [server changelog](https://github.com/GlobedGD/globed2/blob/main/server/changelog.md) as there have been some changes to the server.

Additional changes include:

* Fix bug with blank names when clicking on a user to open their profile
* Make the mute button work immediately instead of with a delay
* Add an automatic rollback system for a certain save bug related to gauntlets
*  ^ in versions before v1.0.5 there used to be a bug that would cause your savefile to have some invalid levels. Now those will be automatically removed on startup.

## v1.0.5

* Preload icons on the loading screen (longer loading time but hopefully a lot less lagspikes in-game now)
* Fix disconnecting when minimizing the game
* Room popup now doesn't auto refresh, and sorts players alphabetically (also your friends are now shown before everyone else!)
